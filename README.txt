# üõ∞Ô∏è JITTR ‚Äî Neural Mouse Tracking for Cognitive Health

Jittr is a browser extension and interactive simulation that analyzes **mouse movements and clicks** to surface **ADHD-like behavioral patterns**. By tracking metrics such as reaction time, path efficiency, and motion variability, Jittr applies a **machine learning model trained on real ADHD datasets** to provide a **probability score** of ADHD-like signals.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Jittr is a research prototype ‚Äî not a medical diagnosis tool.

## Features
- Real-time mouse tracking and analytics
- ADHD-like pattern detection
